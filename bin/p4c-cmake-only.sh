# Only run cmake, which should be done from inside of the p4c/build
# directory.

# If you run this command, it will rescan the testdata/p4_16_samples
# and testdata/p4_14_samples (and other) directories, regenerating
# whatever files in the build directory exist and are used by future
# 'make check' runs.  Thus if you add new test programs in those
# testdata directories, running this 'cmake' command will cause future
# 'make check' runs to also run those tests.

# Configure for a debug build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
# Copied from p4c/Dockerfile
#cmake .. '-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING=-O3'
