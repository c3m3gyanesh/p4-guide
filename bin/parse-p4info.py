One way to install them on an Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 Linux system is to
follow the instructions here for running the installation script
called 'install-p4dev-p4runtime.sh':

https://github.com/jafingerhut/p4-guide/blob/master/bin/README-install-troubleshooting.md

There are likely smaller sets of software packages one can install to
enable this script to work, too, but I do not know what the smallest
set is.

# correct, nested in the way that they should be, and that the types
# of the values are integer/string/etc. as they should be.

######################################################################
# Here are some things that read_p4info_text_format_from_file _does_
# raise an exception for, if it detects it while reading a text format
# P4Info file:

# Any field name present that is not one of those defined in the
# .proto file, e.g. 'tales' instead of 'tables' at the top level, or
# 'preable' instead of 'preamble' inside of any message that has a
# 'preamble' field.  Also 'preamble' correctly spelled at the top
# level, since a P4Info message has no such field.

# If a value is expected of any one of the following types, but a
# different one is found, then an exception is raised:
# + a string, which in the text file has double quotes around it
# + an integer, which must not have quotes around it
# + an 'enum' value, e.g. EXACT, LPM, which must not have quotes around it

######################################################################
# Here are some things that read_p4info_text_format_from_file _does
# not_ raise an exception for:

# If a valid field name is repeated, the last value is kept, and the
# earlier ones are silently ignored.

# If you read a text format P4Info file with the text below for its
# 'type_info' message, it will have two entries in the 'new_types'
# map:

# type_info {
#   new_types {
#     key: "PortId_t"
#     value {
#       translated_type {
#         uri: "p4.org/psa/v1/PortId_t"
#         sdn_bitwidth: 32
#       }
#     }
#   }
#   new_types {
#     key: "ClassOfService_t"
#     value {
#       translated_type {
#         uri: "p4.org/psa/v1/ClassOfService_t"
#         sdn_bitwidth: 8
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }

# However, if you delete the second 'new_types {' line and the one
# right above that, the file will be read with no errors, but the map
# will only contain the key "ClassOfService_t", not "PortId_t".  This
# is probably just a special case of the previous not about repeated
# field names causing only the last occurrence to be preserved, and
# earlier ones silently ignored.

# If an action_refs field of a table has an id with a number X, but X
# appears nowhere else in the file, no exception is raised, even
# though a correct P4Info message should have an 'actions' message
# elsewhere in the file with a 'preamble' field, containing an 'id'
# field with that number X.

# The above is merely one example of such a 'reference' relationship
# of id values that is not checked by
# read_p4info_text_format_from_file.  It is likely that no such
# constraints are checked by that function.

# TBD: Is there a way to get a list of all second parameter values p

# ('tables' in dir(p4info)) is False, for example, so dir() does not help there.
